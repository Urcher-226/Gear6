        <p>Five years after winning the World Martial Arts tournament, SON-Goku is now living a peaceful life with his wife and son. 
            This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Goku's long-lost brother. 
            He reveals that Goku is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Goku's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others. With his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Goku as an ally, Raditz warns Goku's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earthâ€”one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake
             A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z..</p>
